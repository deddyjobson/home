            <h3>Data Scientist - Mercari Inc.</h3>
            <p>Jan 2021 – Present | Tokyo, Japan</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Optimized Marketing ROI:</strong> Led the enhancement of marketing campaigns using advanced statistical models, achieving over a 100% increase in ROI, making the campaigns financially viable. Prior efforts only reached around 60% ROI, but by implementing uplift modeling, I identified key user segments that responded well to campaigns, raising ROI to 120%. This success secured 1 billion yen in funding for future initiatives.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Improved Causal Inference of TV Campaigns:</strong> Deployed Bayesian state-space models to accurately estimate the causal effect of a TV commercial on key business metrics. By addressing the limitations of traditional DID methods, we enhanced the precision of treatment effect estimates, reducing variance and allowing us to detect smaller impacts with greater accuracy (from 10% down to 1%).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Segmented Active Users for Targeted Campaigns:</strong> Defined rule-based metrics to identify active users at risk of churn, leading to the launch of Mercari's first marketing campaign aimed at retaining these valuable users. By developing a "soft churn" metric, we were able to target users gradually becoming inactive, emphasizing those with higher activity levels.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Expanded User Engagement:</strong> Proposed and executed a strategy to encourage active users to explore new product categories, reducing their churn rate. By segmenting users based on their purchase behavior, I demonstrated the importance of encouraging category diversification, leading to improved user retention.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Advanced Analytical Models:</strong> Leveraged hierarchical Bayesian models and uplift models to derive actionable insights from marketing campaigns, helping to describe user behavior and optimize campaign strategies.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Software Engineer - Mercari Inc.</h3>
            <p>Oct 2019 – Dec 2020 | Tokyo, Japan</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reduced Cost Per Acquisition:</strong> Played a key role in lowering the CPA of a marketing campaign targeting new listers by 27%, without compromising the Lister Conversion Rate. Achieved this by using ML to exclude organic users, optimizing campaign efficiency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Continuous Deployment:</strong> Implemented continuous deployment for ML models using CircleCI, setting up cron jobs on Kubernetes to ensure seamless operations. Additionally, collaborated with the marketing team to draft proposals for new campaigns, integrating data-driven strategies.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Research Intern - Université de Rouen Normandie</h3>
            <p>Summer 2019 | Rouen, France</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Contributed to the “ESCAPE” project, which focuses on simulating population evacuation during disasters. Applied Convolutional Neural Networks to cluster boids based on image data, aiding in the development of effective evacuation plans.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Software Developer Intern - Mercari Inc.</h3>
            <p>Summer 2018 | Tokyo, Japan</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Developed a price estimation ML model to infer the price of an item from its image, and successfully compressed the model using weight quantization to fit it into the Mercari app.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Data Scientist Intern - Noteshare Inc.</h3>
            <p>Summer 2017 | Chennai, India</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Created a recommendation engine using collaborative filtering and developed a virtual assistant leveraging NLP methods for Noteshare, an online platform for sharing class notes.
